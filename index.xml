The set-up is seen in the figure below, where the radii are calculate through geometry
The radii come out to be
$$\begin{aligned} r_1 &amp;amp;= d_1 \sqrt{\left(\frac{y}{2d_1-x}\right)^2 + 1} \\ r_3 &amp;amp;= d_3 \sqrt{\left(\frac{y}{2d_1+x}\right)^2 + 1} \\ r_2 &amp;amp;= \sqrt{\left(\frac{y(2d_1-x)}{d_1}\right)^2 + (d_1 - x)^2} \\ r_4 &amp;amp;= \sqrt{\left(\frac{y(2d_1+x)}{d_1}\right)^2 + (d_1 + x)^2} \\ r_5 &amp;amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \end{aligned}.</description></item><item><title>large plasma device at UCLA</title><link>https://kianorr.com/research/lapd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/research/lapd/</guid><description>a picture of the large plasma device

I found a program called Processing, where you can code in Java, C++ or Python. After trying a few simple things, this animation seemed to be pretty cool:
There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. The code for it is below. There are two functions that automatically run, setup() (runs once like __init__) and draw() (continuously runs).</description></item><item><title> my experience at APS DPP 2022</title><link>https://kianorr.com/blog/aps-experience/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/blog/aps-experience/</guid><description>This event took place between Oct 16th and Oct 21st in Washington and was the first APS conference I have attended. I ended up really liking the location. Spokane is a medium sized city, but had the energy of a small town, which I enjoyed quite a bit. They even had a good book shop :)
It was an amazing experience because it basically took every single subfield of plasma and formed it into a convention of great people displaying their work.</description></item><item><title>Handmaid's Tale</title><link>https://kianorr.com/books/handmaids_tale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/books/handmaids_tale/</guid><description>The restrictions of certain freedoms (freedoms to) give freedom from the dangers of the world.

This is also a core value of Earthseed. There is a big emphasis on education because without it</description></item><item><title>Recursion</title><link>https://kianorr.com/books/recursion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/books/recursion/</guid><description>It was alright overall. The idea of using memory as a type of time travel is interesting, but I feel that it got repetitive and I think the climax was way too early. Or at least, the climax near the was not big enough. I also don&amp;rsquo;t understand why Helena had to go back 33 years each time, that&amp;rsquo;s wild. They could have gone back five or so years before everything was addled and tried again. The ending was nice and emotional.</description></item><item><title>TAE</title><link>https://kianorr.com/research/tae/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/research/tae/</guid><description>TAE is a company attempting fusion with an field reversed configuration (FRC) device.
I can&amp;rsquo;t get into specifics, but I&amp;rsquo;m in the spectroscopy group working on a spectrometer diagnostic and it&amp;rsquo;s post-shot processing code, as well as a separate machine learning project.</description></item></channel></rss>
