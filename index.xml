Particle in cell (PIC) is a method to simulate the movement of particles under a force of some kind, which in my case is the electric force, essentially simulating a plasma. At it&amp;rsquo;s core, a (1D) PIC code uses a mesh grid that has bins/cells. The edges of these bins are described by two $x$ coordinates, $x_j$ and $x_{j+1}$ (of course, in 2D or 3D, there&amp;rsquo;s more coords), and within that bin is a particle $i$ with location $r_i$.</description></item><item><title>concert hall simulation</title><link>https://kianorr.com/research/acoustics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/research/acoustics/</guid><description>This simulation attempts to recreate the distribution of sound in square concert halls. The set-up is seen in the figure below, where the radii are calculate through geometry
The radii come out to be
$$\begin{aligned} r_1 &amp;amp;= d_1 \sqrt{\left(\frac{y}{2d_1-x}\right)^2 + 1} \\ r_3 &amp;amp;= d_3 \sqrt{\left(\frac{y}{2d_1+x}\right)^2 + 1} \\ r_2 &amp;amp;= \sqrt{\left(\frac{y(2d_1-x)}{d_1}\right)^2 + (d_1 - x)^2} \\ r_4 &amp;amp;= \sqrt{\left(\frac{y(2d_1+x)}{d_1}\right)^2 + (d_1 + x)^2} \\ r_5 &amp;amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \end{aligned}.</description></item><item><title>large plasma device at UCLA</title><link>https://kianorr.com/research/lapd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/research/lapd/</guid><description>I am in the process of making an APS DPP poster for this research so that will be up soon :)</description></item><item><title>Handmaid's Tale</title><link>https://kianorr.com/books/handmaids_tale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/books/handmaids_tale/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Parable of the Talents</title><link>https://kianorr.com/books/parable_of_the_talents/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/books/parable_of_the_talents/</guid><description>education There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of emphasis on education; the parable of the talents is basically a story about how one should spread and teach others their talents, rather than keep them for themselves. This is also a core value of Earthseed. There is a big emphasis on education because without it

The difference in their ways of thought comes from Marcus&amp;rsquo; years without control with a collar on him — all of his freedom was taken away and there was no way of controlling the chaos.</description></item><item><title>TAE</title><link>https://kianorr.com/research/tae/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/research/tae/</guid><description>woops, I signed an NDA</description></item></channel></rss>
