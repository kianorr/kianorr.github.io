The camping itself went alright &amp;ndash; it was cold, which I expected, but I did not think about how cold the ground was going to be when trying to sleep (didn&amp;rsquo;t bring a mat like a smart person).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took about 700 pictures, each with a 5 second exposure, of the orion nebula with a camera that Matt let me borrow. I used Siril for post-processing, where I essentially followed &lt;a href="https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/742945-how-good-is-siril/">this guide&lt;/a>. I had trouble with the photometric color calibration step (kept on getting an error about plate solving) so I did the manual color calibration instead. This is the result:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RK4 speeds in python, julia, and c++</title><link>https://kianorr.com/posts/rkspeeds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 15:17:05 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/posts/rkspeeds/</guid><description>I wanted look more into Julia because it sounded like python but faster and better.

I found a program called Processing, where you can code in Java, C++ or Python.
After trying a few simple things, this animation seemed to be pretty cool:&lt;/p>
&lt;video class="video-shortcode" preload="auto" playbackspeed="" controls>
&lt;source src="https://kianorr.com/out.mp4" type="video/mp4">
There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem
to support it.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>The code for it is below. There are two functions that automatically run,
&lt;code>setup()&lt;/code> (runs once like &lt;code>__init__&lt;/code>) and &lt;code>draw()&lt;/code> (continuously runs). So I just
continuously increased the radius at which that ellipse is at, as well as it&amp;rsquo;s angle with
a couple sines and cosines to make it dynamic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my experience at APS DPP 2022</title><link>https://kianorr.com/posts/aps-experience/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/posts/aps-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p>This event took place between Oct 16th and Oct 21st in Washington and
was the first APS conference I have attended. I ended up really liking the
location. Spokane is a medium sized city, but had the energy of a small town,
which I enjoyed quite a bit. They even had a good book shop :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was an amazing experience because it basically took every single subfield
of plasma and formed it into a convention of great people displaying their
work.
It exposed me to a lot of new topics like dusty plasmas or runaway electrons,
as well as deepened my interest for other areas like computational plasma.
But I think I could work on talking and introducing myself to people at posters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Handmaid's Tale</title><link>https://kianorr.com/books/handmaids_tale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/books/handmaids_tale/</guid><description>The restrictions of certain freedoms (freedoms to) give freedom from the dangers of the world.

The idea of using memory as a type of time travel is interesting, but I feel that it got repetitive and I think the climax was way too early. Or at least, the climax near the was not big enough. I also don&amp;rsquo;t understand why Helena had to go back 33 years each time, that&amp;rsquo;s wild. They could have gone back five or so years before everything was addled and tried again. The ending was nice and emotional.</description></item><item><title>TAE</title><link>https://kianorr.com/research/tae/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/research/tae/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="FRC" loading="lazy" src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303845074/figure/fig8/AS:669651151376416@1536668684973/Field-reversed-configuration-Reprint-from-Figs-2e5-of-Ref-50.jpg">&lt;/p>

as well as a separate machine learning project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
