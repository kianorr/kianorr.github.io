The set-up is seen in the figure below, where the radii are calculate through geometry
The radii come out to be

There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of emphasis on education; the parable of the talents is basically a story about how one should spread and teach others their talents, rather than keep them for themselves. This is also a core value of Earthseed. There is a big emphasis on education because without it
Change. Lauren&amp;rsquo;s God is change — aka chaos — and Marcus&amp;rsquo; Gods are safety, predictability, etc.. The difference in their ways of thought comes from Marcus&amp;rsquo; years without control with a collar on him — all of his freedom was taken away and there was no way of controlling the chaos.</description></item><item><title>Particle in Cell from Scratch</title><link>https://kianorr.com/research/pic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/research/pic/</guid><description>What is particle in cell? Particle in cell (PIC) is a method to simulate the movement of particles under a force of some kind, which in my case is the electric force, essentially simulating a plasma. At it&amp;rsquo;s core, a PIC code uses a mesh grid that has bins/cells. The edges of these bins are described by two $x$ coordinates, $x_j$ and $x_{j+1}$, and within that bin is a particle $i$ with location $r_i$.</description></item></channel></rss>
