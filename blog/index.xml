I ended up really liking the location. Spokane is a medium sized city, but had the energy of a small town, which I enjoyed quite a bit. They even had a good book shop :)
It was an amazing experience because it basically took every single subfield of plasma and formed it into a convention of great people displaying their work.</description></item></channel></rss>
