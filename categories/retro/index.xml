This tutorial is the culmination of a few YouTube videos from The Retro Future and Odd Tinkering. I liked a lot of their tips, so I decided to add them and my own to this post.

This master table is helpful when making ROM libraries or finding something tried, true, and new to play.
Here is the unfiltered data on Google Sheets. The raw tab has most lists in order, but some lists went from 100-91, 90-81, â€¦, 10-1, so it&amp;rsquo;s either in order or very out of order!</description></item><item><title>Pirate's Folly</title><link>https://splch.github.io/blog/posts/piratesfolly/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splch.github.io/blog/posts/piratesfolly/</guid><description>The Raspberry Pi Pico inspired the release of the Picosystem. I love working with limited hardware as a challenge to improve my programming. I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fair share of 6502 assembly for the NES but recently enjoyed the new RP2040. The Picosystem uses the RP2040 to run games, so I just had to try it out!
I began development of Pirate&amp;rsquo;s Folly, a procedurally generated game. I&amp;rsquo;ve laid the groundwork for terrain and item generation; however, enemy placement is still needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
