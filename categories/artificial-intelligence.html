<mark>13 minutes</mark></small><p>I&rsquo;ve been using the Raspberry Pi Foundation&rsquo;s products for almost a decade now, but they only recently released their first microcontroller. Their custom RP2040 has an ARM Cortex-M0+ chip that, obviously, uses ARM assembly. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn assembly and this is definitely a great opportunity to do so.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/nnfs.html>Neural Networks From Scratch</a></h2><small><i>May 18, 2021</i>

<mark>2 minutes</mark></small><p>The best way to learn how something works is to build it from scratch. Unsurprisingly, the Neural Networks from Scratch book does exactly that.
I had the privilege to edit it alongside Harrison and Daniel, and wanted to write about my experiences editing a technical book.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/poems.html>Poems</a></h2><small><i>September 15, 2019</i>

Your dead are in the fields.
Our fight was stretched on the forest.
A wealth of shadow lies beneath the woodland hills.

Introduction Research The purpose of this paper is to test the ability of deep neural networks (DNNs), using long short-term memory architecture to model video game (VG) music and evaluate its aptitude in expressing thematically diverse emotion.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/wormpi.html>Raspberry Pi and Caenorhabditis Elegans</a></h2><small><i>August 20, 2016</i>

<mark>107 minutes</mark></small><p>One of my first projects was AI projects was taking the OpenWorm C. Elegans brain map and connecting it to a Raspberry Pi. The Pi was integrated with Lego Mindstorms, so the Lego motors would move in the direction the worm wanted to go.</p></section><nav></nav></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
