A simple tutorial will suffice; however, this will help generate the most secure key possible.
Quantum Background The NIST compared the security of RSA and ECC keys and concluded that, with sufficient lengths in key complexity, either standard will suffice.
Shor&rsquo;s algorithm factors coprime numbers, thus is able to recreate the private key to any RSA-generated public key. This NIST paper, however, asserts that Grover&rsquo;s algorithm can be used to recreate the private key to any ECC-generated public key.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/randomness/>Degrees of Randomness and the Law of Large Numbers</a></h2><blockquote>In a previous post comparing quantum and avalanche diode methods of true random number generation, an interesting pattern emerged. The quantum random numbers would pass more STS tests than avalanche diode random numbers. Seemingly, the quantum RNG converges to a mean before the diode RNG.
This should not be the case since both methods produce true random numbers, so this post will be exploring if this is actually occurring and why.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/comparerngs/>Quantum versus Avalanche Breakdown Randomness</a></h2><blockquote>Avalanche breakdown and quantum are two methods for generating true random numbers. Here, we&rsquo;ll compare them for feasibility and quality. The feasibility of a TRNG is how many bits per second it can produce while remaining random. And that leads us into quality which will be determined according to the NIST&rsquo;s STS. We&rsquo;ll also compare these methods against the computer&rsquo;s default RNG as a baseline.
I&rsquo;m using the Arcetri Team&rsquo;s implementation of the STS.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/customqiskitgates/>Custom Gates in Qiskit with Pulse</a></h2><blockquote>Quantum research often requires applying operations in novel ways; however, it&rsquo;s occasionally necessary to create gates to reduce circuit length. If too many operations are applied to a qubit, the quantum state is lost and no valuable insight can be gained. The quantum compiler can optimize these steps, but having the ability to create custom microwave pulses to apply to qubits is valuable.
In this quick tutorial, we will compose a Hadamard pulse and apply it to a qubit through a circuit using Qiskit.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/quantumphysics/>Quantum Physics I</a></h2><blockquote>I began learning quantum mechanics with Professor Allan Adams on MIT OpenCourseWare! This will be an ongoing post about interesting things I learn, as a way to share a computer scientist&rsquo;s perspective on quantum physics as well as to hold myself accountable in finishing the course.
The miracle is not that electrons behave oddly. The miracle is that when you take $10^{26}$ electrons, they behave like cheese! ðŸ§€
The first lecture taught me something fundamental about the term superposition.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/quantumsummer/>Summer of Quantum</a></h2><blockquote>This summer will be affectionately known as the Quantum Summer.
Because of a scheduling mishap, I found myself teaching three quantum courses at once:
Brookhaven National Laboratory Qiskit Global Summer School QuBes Camp This situation pushed me to balance responsibilities and make tons of quantum resources. As a result, I became inspired to buy www.quantumforay.com; a fun play on quantum fourier.
Now, equipped with the QF website, I am inspired to make an amazing quantum curriculum from determining what worked best at the three quantum schools.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/quantumtales/>Quantum Tales</a></h2><blockquote>Shortly after becoming an IBM Qiskit Advocate, I was introduced to the Unitary Fund. After writing a story where the reader uses Shor&rsquo;s algorithm to decrypt a stock listing, I wanted to create more stories teaching quantum algorithms.
With the help of the Unitary Fund, I was able to realize this dream. I created a series of stories that teach various quantum algorithms. The stories are all rooted in classic fairy tales from around the world, except the protagonist now employees their quantum prowess to succeed.</blockquote></section></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
