<mark>3 minutes</mark></small><p>The Raspberry Pi Pico inspired the release of the Picosystem. I love working with limited hardware as a challenge to improve my programming. I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of 6502 assembly for the NES but recently enjoyed the new RP2040. The Picosystem uses the RP2040 to run games, so I just had to try it out!</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/solarpoweredsite/>Efficient Solar-Powered Website</a></h2><small><i>November 7, 2021</i>

<mark>3 minutes</mark></small><p>After seeing Kris&rsquo; solar-powered website, I decided I wanted my own to be the same. This conveniently followed the release of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a low-power SoC. I purchased this board since I doubt my website will warrant anything stronger than a Raspberry Pi and it enables solar-power with its small energy footprint.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/assemblypico/>Assembly Neural Network on Pico</a></h2><small><i>September 10, 2021</i>

<mark>13 minutes</mark></small><p>I&rsquo;ve been using the Raspberry Pi Foundation&rsquo;s products for almost a decade now, but they only recently released their first microcontroller. Their custom RP2040 has an ARM Cortex-M0+ chip that, obviously, uses ARM assembly. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn assembly and this is definitely a great opportunity to do so.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/wormpi/>Raspberry Pi and Caenorhabditis Elegans</a></h2><small><i>August 20, 2016</i>

<mark>107 minutes</mark></small><p>One of my first projects was AI projects was taking the OpenWorm C. Elegans brain map and connecting it to a Raspberry Pi. The Pi was integrated with Lego Mindstorms, so the Lego motors would move in the direction the worm wanted to go.</p></section><nav></nav></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
