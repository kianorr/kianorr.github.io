I love working with limited hardware as a challenge to improve my programming. I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of 6502 assembly for the NES but recently enjoyed the new RP2040. The Picosystem uses the RP2040 to run games, so I just had to try it out!
I began development of Pirate&rsquo;s Folly, a procedurally generated game. I&rsquo;ve laid the groundwork for terrain and item generation; however, enemy placement is still needed.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/solarpoweredsite/>Efficient Solar-Powered Website</a></h2><blockquote>After seeing Kris&rsquo; solar-powered website, I decided I wanted my own to be the same. This conveniently followed the release of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a low-power SoC. I purchased this board since I doubt my website will warrant anything stronger than a Raspberry Pi and it enables solar-power with its small energy footprint.
There is a thorough article comparing servers&rsquo; abilities handling different types of data; however, I opted to use Go&rsquo;s built-in web server.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/assemblypico/>Assembly Neural Network on Pico</a></h2><blockquote>I&rsquo;ve been using the Raspberry Pi Foundation&rsquo;s products for almost a decade now, but they only recently released their first microcontroller. Their custom RP2040 has an ARM Cortex-M0+ chip that, obviously, uses ARM assembly. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn assembly and this is definitely a great opportunity to do so.
The goal is to code a very basic neural network in assembly.
I want to make a simple neural network, and luckily the Pico has a multiplication instruction (unlike the 6502 processor).</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/wormpi/>Raspberry Pi and Caenorhabditis Elegans</a></h2><blockquote>One of my first projects was AI projects was taking the OpenWorm C. Elegans brain map and connecting it to a Raspberry Pi. The Pi was integrated with Lego Mindstorms, so the Lego motors would move in the direction the worm wanted to go.
# BrickPi3 Worm Brain # Written by Spencer Churchill 2016, in Python 2.7 # The BrickPi3 Worm Brain uses a Postsynaptic dictionary based on the C Elegans Connectome Model # This application can be ran on the Raspberry Pi BrickPi robot with an ultrasonic sensor that represents Nose Touch when activated from BrickPi import * import time BrickPiSetup() # setup the serial port for communication BrickPi.</blockquote></section></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
