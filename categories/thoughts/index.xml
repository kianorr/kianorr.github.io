It began on 1 April 2022, and lasted for four days, including two expansions across the experiment. As of Sunday night, 3 April, nearly 72 million tiles were placed by over 6 million users, at a pace of more than 2.5 million tiles placed per hour; it was a sixfold increase in the number of users on Reddit between the two experiments, including a 4.</description></item><item><title>The Meanest Color</title><link>/posts/meancolor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/meancolor/</guid><description>Have you ever wanted to know what the most mean color is? Red might come to mind — a fiery and belligerent color. But I&amp;rsquo;ll do one better! I&amp;rsquo;ll give you the color vector that&amp;rsquo;s closest to every other color vector.
Here, the most average and mean color can be determined with word2vec and vector averaging.
Process Load the word2vec model Load the list of colors Sum the vectors of each color together Divide by the number of colors Find the color vector with the largest cosine similarity to that vector Python pip install gensim import numpy import gensim.</description></item><item><title>My First Car</title><link>/posts/firsttruck/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/firsttruck/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been curious about how to repair cars since debugging tends to follow similar thought processes. Today, I finally got my first car, a 1988 Toyota Pickup affectionately known as Lil&amp;rsquo; Mo. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to learn how to work on its famous 22R-E engine and handle wiring for the electronics.
Music is my biggest priority after safety, so having a bangin&amp;rsquo; stereo is a must. After that, the appearance of the truck is important since I tend to get smiles or thumbs up when driving it.</description></item><item><title>Delete Me Guides</title><link>/posts/deletemeguides/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/deletemeguides/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to create a simple program that will delete personal information like deleteme.

The only unique thing I did in regards with the initial application was specifying my interest in the ChromeOS team. In addition, I submitted a bug report to the ChromeOS team and mentioned my application. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this helped move me forward, but it was something different I did compared to previous applications.

The catch was that the encoded QR code would match the encoded string of the QR code. When you scan the QR code, it would return itself.
Sadly, this is most likely impossible, though I might still try to create a search function for it. Instead, I optimized Alok&amp;rsquo;s approach a bit with Javascript&amp;rsquo;s arrow syntax.</description></item><item><title>The Last Single-Letter Domain</title><link>/posts/lastis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/lastis/</guid><description>ý.is is now taken.

In order to avoid targeted ads and refining my digital consciousness, I&amp;rsquo;m making steady progress toward respectful technology.
After learning more about AI, I began to understand the importance of privacy. Everyone has their own reasons for protecting their data, and mine is to reduce the ability of models to fit me. This ties into preventing ad recommendations and other popular motivations broadly, but I doubt we understand the implications of modelling human behavior.</description></item><item><title>Testing DuckDuckGo's Email</title><link>/posts/pentestddg/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pentestddg/</guid><description>DuckDuckGo began releasing @duck.com emails. These emails are currently in beta and only act as an email-forwarding account. The purpose of this post is to stess-test the service and see where it earns the beta tag.
Duck.com vs. Duck.co Both duck.com and duck.co forward to duckduckgo.com, so I wondered if a duck.com and duck.co email forward emails identically as well. When I tried emailing spence@duck.co, however, I received the following 550 error:</description></item><item><title>The Best TLD is Not .com</title><link>/posts/tlds/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/tlds/</guid><description>The TLD is controlled by its parent company or country. When choosing a TLD, consider the site to be strictly under the laws of the country that ultimate controls it. For example, if you use a .ae domain, with a single query from the monarchy, your site could be completely removed. On the otherhand, if you use a domain from… well let&amp;rsquo;s get into it 😉

I&amp;rsquo;m only leaving IPFS because this site will never be popular enough to be on any node besides my own. In this way, I was already hosting from the start. It all began as a fun endeavor to apply Go, but has since led to a certificate and obsessive refinement of the server.

Because of a scheduling mishap, I found myself teaching three quantum courses at once:
Brookhaven National Laboratory Qiskit Global Summer School QuBes Camp This situation pushed me to balance responsibilities and make tons of quantum resources. As a result, I became inspired to buy www.quantumforay.com; a fun play on quantum fourier.
Now, equipped with the QF website, I am inspired to make an amazing quantum curriculum from determining what worked best at the three quantum schools.</description></item><item><title>Tools For Writing</title><link>/posts/writingtools/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/writingtools/</guid><description>Half a year ago, I began the process of writing my first book. This book is special to me because it attempts to teach middle schoolers and those without experience, quantum. By using fairy tales everyone is familiar with, it is easier to teach new topics. I found that younger audiences were able to learn new material better when that knowledge was introduced in the context of popular stories. In this way, I will use stories from around the world to help teach many people the basics of quantum and inspire them to learn more.</description></item><item><title>Future of Blockchain Domains</title><link>/posts/blockchain/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/blockchain/</guid><description>I bought this domain (splch.zil) today! I have a .dev/net domain, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of renting a space. When I discovered blockchain domain names and IPFS hosting, I knew it suited me.
It all depends on security and privacy Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the future holds for blockchain and IPFS internet, but I think that the importance of publicly served domains will increase by considering present privacy trends.</description></item><item><title>Converting Country Codes to Flag Emojis</title><link>/posts/flag2emoji/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/flag2emoji/</guid><description>In a Flutter app I started — and eventually stopped — working on, I was converting country codes to their corresponding flag emojis in Dart.

Your dead are in the fields.
Our fight was stretched on the forest.
A wealth of shadow lies beneath the woodland hills.
An earth that is not mine.
Skies A sky became a wave,
and suddenly the breeze -
azure floating on the hills.
Our music was not of a god or spirit, not of that colour of the sea.
