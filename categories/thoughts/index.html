It began on 1 April 2022, and lasted for four days, including two expansions across the experiment. As of Sunday night, 3 April, nearly 72 million tiles were placed by over 6 million users, at a pace of more than 2.5 million tiles placed per hour; it was a sixfold increase in the number of users on Reddit between the two experiments, including a 4.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/meancolor/>The Meanest Color</a></h2><blockquote>Have you ever wanted to know what the most mean color is? Red might come to mind — a fiery and belligerent color. But I&rsquo;ll do one better! I&rsquo;ll give you the color vector that&rsquo;s closest to every other color vector.
Here, the most average and mean color can be determined with word2vec and vector averaging.
Process Load the word2vec model Load the list of colors Sum the vectors of each color together Divide by the number of colors Find the color vector with the largest cosine similarity to that vector Python pip install gensim import numpy import gensim.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/firsttruck/>My First Car</a></h2><blockquote>I&rsquo;ve always been curious about how to repair cars since debugging tends to follow similar thought processes. Today, I finally got my first car, a 1988 Toyota Pickup affectionately known as Lil&rsquo; Mo. I&rsquo;m excited to learn how to work on its famous 22R-E engine and handle wiring for the electronics.
Music is my biggest priority after safety, so having a bangin&rsquo; stereo is a must. After that, the appearance of the truck is important since I tend to get smiles or thumbs up when driving it.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/deletemeguides/>Delete Me Guides</a></h2><blockquote>I&rsquo;m going to create a simple program that will delete personal information like deleteme. It&rsquo;ll be open-source and able to run whenever you please. I&rsquo;ll use the guides from deleteme to help identify services and their links.
I have each link listed below, but you can run the code below to download every document.

The only unique thing I did in regards with the initial application was specifying my interest in the ChromeOS team. In addition, I submitted a bug report to the ChromeOS team and mentioned my application. I don&rsquo;t know if this helped move me forward, but it was something different I did compared to previous applications.

The catch was that the encoded QR code would match the encoded string of the QR code. When you scan the QR code, it would return itself.
Sadly, this is most likely impossible, though I might still try to create a search function for it. Instead, I optimized Alok&rsquo;s approach a bit with Javascript&rsquo;s arrow syntax.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/lastis/>The Last Single-Letter Domain</a></h2><blockquote>ý.is is now taken.

Recently, I added code that scrapes DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s !bangs; however, the reader would need to run the code on their own machine. It&rsquo;d be helpful if they could have executable code embedded in the post.
I searched the internet for popular online IDEs and found those listed below. I wanted to compare features and languages to determine which I should use in my blog (if any).</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/privacytools/>Exploring Privacy Tools</a></h2><blockquote>The brain has been hacked and its security patches come slowly. In order to avoid targeted ads and refining my digital consciousness, I&rsquo;m making steady progress toward respectful technology.
After learning more about AI, I began to understand the importance of privacy. Everyone has their own reasons for protecting their data, and mine is to reduce the ability of models to fit me. This ties into preventing ad recommendations and other popular motivations broadly, but I doubt we understand the implications of modelling human behavior.</blockquote></section></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
