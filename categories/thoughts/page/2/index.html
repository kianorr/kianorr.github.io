These emails are currently in beta and only act as an email-forwarding account. The purpose of this post is to stess-test the service and see where it earns the beta tag.
Duck.com vs. Duck.co Both duck.com and duck.co forward to duckduckgo.com, so I wondered if a duck.com and duck.co email forward emails identically as well. When I tried emailing spence@duck.co, however, I received the following 550 error:</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../../posts/tlds/>The Best TLD is Not .com</a></h2><blockquote>The TLD is controlled by its parent company or country. When choosing a TLD, consider the site to be strictly under the laws of the country that ultimate controls it. For example, if you use a .ae domain, with a single query from the monarchy, your site could be completely removed. On the otherhand, if you use a domain from‚Ä¶ well let&rsquo;s get into it üòâ
The EFF outlined a comparison of TLDs.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../../posts/grokkinggo/>Grokking Go</a></h2><blockquote>Despite an earlier post being so optimistic about the IPFS, I decided to self-host this site. I&rsquo;m only leaving IPFS because this site will never be popular enough to be on any node besides my own. In this way, I was already hosting from the start. It all began as a fun endeavor to apply Go, but has since led to a certificate and obsessive refinement of the server.
Most recently, I have added the ability to edit and create posts from within this site!</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../../posts/quantumsummer/>Summer of Quantum</a></h2><blockquote>This summer will be affectionately known as the Quantum Summer.
Because of a scheduling mishap, I found myself teaching three quantum courses at once:
Brookhaven National Laboratory Qiskit Global Summer School QuBes Camp This situation pushed me to balance responsibilities and make tons of quantum resources. As a result, I became inspired to buy www.quantumforay.com; a fun play on quantum fourier.
Now, equipped with the QF website, I am inspired to make an amazing quantum curriculum from determining what worked best at the three quantum schools.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../../posts/writingtools/>Tools For Writing</a></h2><blockquote>Half a year ago, I began the process of writing my first book. This book is special to me because it attempts to teach middle schoolers and those without experience, quantum. By using fairy tales everyone is familiar with, it is easier to teach new topics. I found that younger audiences were able to learn new material better when that knowledge was introduced in the context of popular stories. In this way, I will use stories from around the world to help teach many people the basics of quantum and inspire them to learn more.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../../posts/blockchain/>Future of Blockchain Domains</a></h2><blockquote>I bought this domain (splch.zil) today! I have a .dev/net domain, but I don&rsquo;t like the idea of renting a space. When I discovered blockchain domain names and IPFS hosting, I knew it suited me.
It all depends on security and privacy Now, I don&rsquo;t know what the future holds for blockchain and IPFS internet, but I think that the importance of publicly served domains will increase by considering present privacy trends.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../../posts/flag2emoji/>Converting Country Codes to Flag Emojis</a></h2><blockquote>In a Flutter app I started ‚Äî and eventually stopped ‚Äî working on, I was converting country codes to their corresponding flag emojis in Dart. This was a fun problem to solve and it&rsquo;s actually my highest rated solution on StackOverflow, so I wanted to save it here!
String countryCode = 'us'; String flag = countryCode.toUpperCase().replaceAllMapped(RegExp(r'[A-Z]'), (match) => String.fromCharCode(match.group(0).codeUnitAt(0) + 127397)); print(flag); .toUpperCase() Make all characters uppercase</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../../posts/poems/>Poems</a></h2><blockquote>Alexandre Alexandre, my trembling wings.
Your dead are in the fields.
Our fight was stretched on the forest.
A wealth of shadow lies beneath the woodland hills.
An earth that is not mine.
Skies A sky became a wave,
and suddenly the breeze -
azure floating on the hills.
Our music was not of a god or spirit, not of that colour of the sea.
falafel My falafel from the seas and palm-trees.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../../posts/m-protect/>M-Protect</a></h2><blockquote>M-Protect, the virus protector that promised everything and fulfilled nothing, was an overnight sensation. After amassing a cult following of thirteen-year-olds and becoming the sponsor of the school&rsquo;s crossfire tournament, this antivirus program was seemingly on the up and up. However, its ambition would become its downfall.
Getting things done ‚Äî that&rsquo;s the M-Protect way
