For fusion week in 2024, fusion trading cards were handed out and I ended up being the artist 
for 3 of them.

I really enjoyed making these because I was able to play around with some different art styles also while contributing to something that I care about.

## C2W
I am most familiar with C2W so I started out with this. I played around with using different colored squares/rectangles, in kind of a "japanese-pop" style. I think it's kind of cool.

## Laser Megajoule
I think the original sketch for this one was better than the final product, mainly because 
I had a really hard time getting the perspective right. The colors I used were similar to the ones
I used with C2W, while also drawing inspiration some other comic book styles.

## LAPD
I had already made something for the LAPD in the poster I presented at [APS 2022]({{< ref "aps-experience" >}}) so this wasn't too hard to make but 
I had fun with the background. The bottom is a discrete gradient while the top is continuous. I think I used the same colors that Phil uses 
in his BPSF presentations (kinda vaporwave).

I think you can buy the whole deck [here](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/sell/marketplace/fusion-trading-cards-2024.html) (Oak was the one in charge of eveverything).
