This event took place between Oct 16th and Oct 21st in Washington and 
was the first APS conference I have attended. I ended up really liking the
location. Spokane is a medium sized city, but had the energy of a small town,
which I enjoyed quite a bit. They even had a good book shop :)

It was an amazing experience because it basically took every single subfield 
of plasma and formed it into a convention of great people displaying their
work.
It exposed me to a lot of new topics like dusty plasmas or runaway electrons, 
as well as deepened my interest for other areas like computational plasma. 
But I think I could work on talking and introducing myself to people at posters.

One talk that I enjoyed was by Tunde Fulop and was about runaway electrons 
in tokamaks. 
I learned about the causes (seeds) of runaways -- the avalanche effect is 
especially interesting since that is what causes lightning. 
So there is essentially lighting going on in a tokamak (no wonder we are researching 
them for safety). 
For work, I actually made a slide to summarize Tunde's presentation.

I also presented a poster for my work at UCLA, which you can find [here](/poster.pdf).
I did this undergraduate research with Troy Carter and Phil Travis :)
