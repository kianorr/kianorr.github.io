I found a program called Processing, where you can code in Java, C++ or Python. After trying a few simple things, this animation seemed to be pretty cool:
There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. The code for it is below. There are two functions that automatically run, setup() (runs once like __init__) and draw() (continuously runs).</description></item></channel></rss>
