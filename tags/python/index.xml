I found a program called Processing, where you can code in Java, C++ or Python.
After trying a few simple things, this animation seemed to be pretty cool:&lt;/p>

There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem
to support it.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>The code for it is below. There are two functions that automatically run,
&lt;code>setup()&lt;/code> (runs once like &lt;code>__init__&lt;/code>) and &lt;code>draw()&lt;/code> (continuously runs). So I just
continuously increased the radius at which that ellipse is at, as well as it&amp;rsquo;s angle with
a couple sines and cosines to make it dynamic.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
