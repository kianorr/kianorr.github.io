&lt;p>I really enjoyed making these because I was able to play around with some different art styles also while contributing to something that I care about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>code and graphic design</title><link>https://kianorr.com/posts/code-graphics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 15:17:05 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/posts/code-graphics/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wanted to look into the intersection between graphic design and code.
I found a program called Processing, where you can code in Java, C++ or Python.
After trying a few simple things, this animation seemed to be pretty cool:&lt;/p>

There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem
to support it.

&lt;p>The code for it is below. There are two functions that automatically run,
&lt;code>setup()&lt;/code> (runs once like &lt;code>__init__&lt;/code>) and &lt;code>draw()&lt;/code> (continuously runs). So I just
continuously increased the radius at which that ellipse is at, as well as it&amp;rsquo;s angle with
a couple sines and cosines to make it dynamic.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
