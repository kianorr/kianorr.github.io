It began on 1 April 2022, and lasted for four days, including two expansions across the experiment. As of Sunday night, 3 April, nearly 72 million tiles were placed by over 6 million users, at a pace of more than 2.5 million tiles placed per hour; it was a sixfold increase in the number of users on Reddit between the two experiments, including a 4.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/minecraftseeds/>Minecraft Seeds</a></h2><blockquote>Title Screen: Version: Beta 1.7.3 Seed: 2151901553968352745 or 8091867987493326313 Player X: 61.48 Player Y: 75 Player Z: -68.73 Pack.png: Version: Alpha 1.2.2 [Java] Seed: 3257840388504953787 Player X: 116 Player Y: -31 Skull on Fire: Version: Alpha 1.1.2_01 [Java] Seed: -1044887956651363087 or -6984854390176336655 Player X: -249.65 Player Y: 91 Player Z: -29.04 Speedrunning: Version: 1.17.41 Seed: 376166226 Player X: 0 Player Y: 0 Interesting Seeds: 7 Wonders:</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/doloremipsum/>Dolorem Ipsum</a></h2><blockquote>How would Cicero feel if he learned most knew him through Lorem Ipsum? I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d lose his head… again. To further Herennius&rsquo; delight, Cicero didn&rsquo;t even write those lines! To do justice to his legacy, I present Cicerkov: The Cicero Markov Chain.
To follow along, download his work here. There is an interactive demo in JavaScript below, though, but it uses a prerun model of window size two.

The only unique thing I did in regards with the initial application was specifying my interest in the ChromeOS team. In addition, I submitted a bug report to the ChromeOS team and mentioned my application. I don&rsquo;t know if this helped move me forward, but it was something different I did compared to previous applications.

The catch was that the encoded QR code would match the encoded string of the QR code. When you scan the QR code, it would return itself.
Sadly, this is most likely impossible, though I might still try to create a search function for it. Instead, I optimized Alok&rsquo;s approach a bit with Javascript&rsquo;s arrow syntax.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/runcode/>Searching for Interactive Code</a></h2><blockquote>I want readers to execute code I use anywhere in my blog. Recently, I added code that scrapes DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s !bangs; however, the reader would need to run the code on their own machine. It&rsquo;d be helpful if they could have executable code embedded in the post.
I searched the internet for popular online IDEs and found those listed below. I wanted to compare features and languages to determine which I should use in my blog (if any).</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/quantumsummer/>Summer of Quantum</a></h2><blockquote>This summer will be affectionately known as the Quantum Summer.
Because of a scheduling mishap, I found myself teaching three quantum courses at once:
Brookhaven National Laboratory Qiskit Global Summer School QuBes Camp This situation pushed me to balance responsibilities and make tons of quantum resources. As a result, I became inspired to buy www.quantumforay.com; a fun play on quantum fourier.
Now, equipped with the QF website, I am inspired to make an amazing quantum curriculum from determining what worked best at the three quantum schools.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/flag2emoji/>Converting Country Codes to Flag Emojis</a></h2><blockquote>In a Flutter app I started — and eventually stopped — working on, I was converting country codes to their corresponding flag emojis in Dart. This was a fun problem to solve and it&rsquo;s actually my highest rated solution on StackOverflow, so I wanted to save it here!
String countryCode = 'us'; String flag = countryCode.toUpperCase().replaceAllMapped(RegExp(r'[A-Z]'), (match) => String.fromCharCode(match.group(0).codeUnitAt(0) + 127397)); print(flag); .toUpperCase() Make all characters uppercase</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/ee/>IB CS Extended Essay</a></h2><blockquote>&ldquo;How feasible are deep neural networks in generating thematically diverse video game music?&rdquo;
Introduction Research The purpose of this paper is to test the ability of deep neural networks (DNNs), using long short-term memory architecture to model video game (VG) music and evaluate its aptitude in expressing thematically diverse emotion. In other words, how feasible are deep neural networks in generating thematic video game music? My goal is to test whether a DNN can compose engaging music capable of accentuating themes presented in video games.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/wormpi/>Raspberry Pi and Caenorhabditis Elegans</a></h2><blockquote>One of my first projects was AI projects was taking the OpenWorm C. Elegans brain map and connecting it to a Raspberry Pi. The Pi was integrated with Lego Mindstorms, so the Lego motors would move in the direction the worm wanted to go.
