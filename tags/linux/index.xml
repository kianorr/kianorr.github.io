The quantum random numbers would pass more STS tests than avalanche diode random numbers. Seemingly, the quantum RNG converges to a mean before the diode RNG.</description></item><item><title>Installing Manjaro Linux on Chromebook</title><link>/posts/manjarochromebook.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/manjarochromebook.html</guid><description>1.
