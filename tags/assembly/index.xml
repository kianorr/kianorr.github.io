Their custom RP2040 has an ARM Cortex-M0+ chip that, obviously, uses ARM assembly. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to learn assembly and this is definitely a great opportunity to do so.
The goal is to code a very basic neural network in assembly.
I want to make a simple neural network, and luckily the Pico has a multiplication instruction (unlike the 6502 processor).</description></item></channel></rss>
