Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll compare them for feasibility and quality. The feasibility of a TRNG is how many bits per second it can produce while remaining random. And that leads us into quality which will be determined according to the NIST&amp;rsquo;s STS.</description></item><item><title>Custom Gates in Qiskit with Pulse</title><link>/posts/customqiskitgates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/customqiskitgates/</guid><description>Quantum research often requires applying operations in novel ways; however, it&amp;rsquo;s occasionally necessary to create gates to reduce circuit length. If too many operations are applied to a qubit, the quantum state is lost and no valuable insight can be gained.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Tales</title><link>/posts/quantumtales/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/quantumtales/</guid><description>Shortly after becoming an IBM Qiskit Advocate, I was introduced to the Unitary Fund. After writing a story where the reader uses Shor&amp;rsquo;s algorithm to decrypt a stock listing, I wanted to create more stories teaching quantum algorithms.
With the help of the Unitary Fund, I was able to realize this dream.</description></item></channel></rss>
