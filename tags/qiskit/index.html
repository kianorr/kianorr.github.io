<mark>10 minutes</mark></small><p>Avalanche breakdown and quantum are two methods for generating true random numbers. Here, we&rsquo;ll compare them for feasibility and quality. The feasibility of a TRNG is how many bits per second it can produce while remaining random. And that leads us into quality which will be determined according to the NIST&rsquo;s STS.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/customqiskitgates/>Custom Gates in Qiskit with Pulse</a></h2><small><i>December 7, 2021</i>

<mark>4 minutes</mark></small><p>Quantum research often requires applying operations in novel ways; however, it&rsquo;s occasionally necessary to create gates to reduce circuit length. If too many operations are applied to a qubit, the quantum state is lost and no valuable insight can be gained.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/quantumtales/>Quantum Tales</a></h2><small><i>May 18, 2021</i>
|</small><p>Shortly after becoming an IBM Qiskit Advocate, I was introduced to the Unitary Fund. After writing a story where the reader uses Shor&rsquo;s algorithm to decrypt a stock listing, I wanted to create more stories teaching quantum algorithms.
With the help of the Unitary Fund, I was able to realize this dream.</p></section><nav></nav></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
