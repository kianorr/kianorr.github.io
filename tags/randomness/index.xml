The quantum random numbers would pass more STS tests than avalanche diode random numbers. Seemingly, the quantum RNG converges to a mean before the diode RNG.
This should not be the case since both methods produce true random numbers, so this post will be exploring if this is actually occurring and why.</description></item><item><title>Quantum versus Avalanche Breakdown Randomness</title><link>/posts/comparerngs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/comparerngs/</guid><description>Avalanche breakdown and quantum are two methods for generating true random numbers. Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll compare them for feasibility and quality. The feasibility of a TRNG is how many bits per second it can produce while remaining random. And that leads us into quality which will be determined according to the NIST&amp;rsquo;s STS. We&amp;rsquo;ll also compare these methods against the computer&amp;rsquo;s default RNG as a baseline.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the Arcetri Team&amp;rsquo;s implementation of the STS.</description></item></channel></rss>
