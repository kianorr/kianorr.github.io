The quantum random numbers would pass more STS tests than avalanche diode random numbers. Seemingly, the quantum RNG converges to a mean before the diode RNG.</description></item><item><title>Quantum versus Avalanche Breakdown Randomness</title><link>/posts/comparerngs.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/comparerngs.html</guid><description>Avalanche breakdown and quantum are two methods for generating true random numbers. Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll compare them for feasibility and quality. The feasibility of a TRNG is how many bits per second it can produce while remaining random. And that leads us into quality which will be determined according to the NIST&amp;rsquo;s STS.</description></item></channel></rss>
