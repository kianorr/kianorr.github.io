I&rsquo;m only leaving IPFS because this site will never be popular enough to be on any node besides my own. In this way, I was already hosting from the start. It all began as a fun endeavor to apply Go, but has since led to a <a href=https://github.com/splch/google-go-coursera>certificate</a> and obsessive refinement of the <a href=https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/slc.is>server</a>.</p><p>Most recently, I have added the ability to edit and create posts from within this site! There&rsquo;s quite a bit going on in the server&mldr; particularly in one file ðŸ˜³, so I should look into splitting the code into separate files: one for setting up the server, and another for parsing the markdown.</p><p>I am really enjoying Go, though. I&rsquo;m more comfortable with interpreted languages as Python was my first; however, I am quickly converting to a statically-typed fan! Also, this is my first post using the new website editor ðŸ¤ª</p><p>This is the code for my Go server hosted on Replit. <a href=https://replit.com>Replit</a> makes for an easy hosting provider, as well. I can make updates quickly without worrying about power outages causing the site to go down. Initially, I was using the <abbr title="GNU's Not Unix! ZIP">gzip</abbr> package from Go&rsquo;s standard library, but audio couldn&rsquo;t be decoded. I opted to use the package by the New York Times instead. The server configuration is primarily based on three sources: <a href=https://blog.cloudflare.com/exposing-go-on-the-internet/>Cloudflare</a>, <a href="https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=go&version=1.16.7&config=intermediate&guideline=5.6">Mozilla</a>, and their <a href=https://observatory.mozilla.org/>observatory</a> tool.</p><iframe class=web width=100% frameborder=0 src="https://replit.com/@splch/slcis?lite=1"></iframe></main><footer><small>Thanks to <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> for building and <a href=https://simplecss.org/>SimpleCSS</a>
