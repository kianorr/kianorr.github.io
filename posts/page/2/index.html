<mark>4 minutes</mark></small><p>I&rsquo;ve always been curious about how to repair cars since debugging tends to follow similar thought processes. Today, I finally got my first car, a 1988 Toyota Pickup affectionately known as Lil&rsquo; Mo. I&rsquo;m excited to learn how to work on its famous 22R-E engine and handle wiring for the electronics.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/comparerngs/>Quantum versus Avalanche Breakdown Randomness</a></h2><small><i>December 8, 2021</i>

<mark>10 minutes</mark></small><p>Avalanche breakdown and quantum are two methods for generating true random numbers. Here, we&rsquo;ll compare them for feasibility and quality. The feasibility of a TRNG is how many bits per second it can produce while remaining random. And that leads us into quality which will be determined according to the NIST&rsquo;s STS.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/customqiskitgates/>Custom Gates in Qiskit with Pulse</a></h2><small><i>December 7, 2021</i>

<mark>4 minutes</mark></small><p>Quantum research often requires applying operations in novel ways; however, it&rsquo;s occasionally necessary to create gates to reduce circuit length. If too many operations are applied to a qubit, the quantum state is lost and no valuable insight can be gained.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/manjarochromebook/>Installing Manjaro Linux on Chromebook</a></h2><small><i>December 6, 2021</i>

<mark>2 minutes</mark></small><p>I&rsquo;m going to create a simple program that will delete personal information like deleteme. It&rsquo;ll be open-source and able to run whenever you please. I&rsquo;ll use the guides from deleteme to help identify services and their links.
I have each link listed below, but you can run the code below to download every document.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/minecraftseeds/>Minecraft Seeds</a></h2><small><i>November 15, 2021</i>

<mark>3 minutes</mark></small><p>How would Cicero feel if he learned most knew him through Lorem Ipsum? I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d lose his head… again. To further Herennius&rsquo; delight, Cicero didn&rsquo;t even write those lines! To do justice to his legacy, I present Cicerkov: The Cicero Markov Chain.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/solarpoweredsite/>Efficient Solar-Powered Website</a></h2><small><i>November 7, 2021</i>

<mark>3 minutes</mark></small><p>After seeing Kris&rsquo; solar-powered website, I decided I wanted my own to be the same. This conveniently followed the release of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a low-power SoC. I purchased this board since I doubt my website will warrant anything stronger than a Raspberry Pi and it enables solar-power with its small energy footprint.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/googleinterview/>Short and Sweet Google Interview Process</a></h2><small><i>September 29, 2021</i>

<mark>3 minutes</mark></small><p>I&rsquo;ll use this post as a progress report of the Google Internship application process. The only unique thing I did in regards with the initial application was specifying my interest in the ChromeOS team. In addition, I submitted a bug report to the ChromeOS team and mentioned my application.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/qrquine/>QR Quine</a></h2><small><i>September 25, 2021</i>
