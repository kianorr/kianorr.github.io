I love working with limited hardware as a challenge to improve my programming. I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of 6502 assembly for the NES but recently enjoyed the new RP2040. The Picosystem uses the RP2040 to run games, so I just had to try it out!
I began development of Pirate&rsquo;s Folly, a procedurally generated game. I&rsquo;ve laid the groundwork for terrain and item generation; however, enemy placement is still needed.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/firsttruck/>My First Car</a></h2><blockquote>I&rsquo;ve always been curious about how to repair cars since debugging tends to follow similar thought processes. Today, I finally got my first car, a 1988 Toyota Pickup affectionately known as Lil&rsquo; Mo. I&rsquo;m excited to learn how to work on its famous 22R-E engine and handle wiring for the electronics.
Music is my biggest priority after safety, so having a bangin&rsquo; stereo is a must. After that, the appearance of the truck is important since I tend to get smiles or thumbs up when driving it.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/comparerngs/>Quantum versus Avalanche Breakdown Randomness</a></h2><blockquote>Avalanche breakdown and quantum are two methods for generating true random numbers. Here, we&rsquo;ll compare them for feasibility and quality. The feasibility of a TRNG is how many bits per second it can produce while remaining random. And that leads us into quality which will be determined according to the NIST&rsquo;s STS. We&rsquo;ll also compare these methods against the computer&rsquo;s default RNG as a baseline.
I&rsquo;m using the Arcetri Team&rsquo;s implementation of the STS.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/customqiskitgates/>Custom Gates in Qiskit with Pulse</a></h2><blockquote>Quantum research often requires applying operations in novel ways; however, it&rsquo;s occasionally necessary to create gates to reduce circuit length. If too many operations are applied to a qubit, the quantum state is lost and no valuable insight can be gained. The quantum compiler can optimize these steps, but having the ability to create custom microwave pulses to apply to qubits is valuable.
In this quick tutorial, we will compose a Hadamard pulse and apply it to a qubit through a circuit using Qiskit.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/manjarochromebook/>Installing Manjaro Linux on Chromebook</a></h2><blockquote>1. Enable Developer Mode You&rsquo;ll need to hold the escape (esc) and refresh (⟳) keys together. While holding them, press the power button to turn on the Chromebook.
Chrome will get nervous and show this screen.
When you boot, you&rsquo;ll need to access the disabled verified boot with control and D (ctrl+d).
Now, press enter to turn OS verification off.
Once the Chromebook boots, shut it down.
2. Enable Debug Mode You can do this by removing the battery.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/deletemeguides/>Delete Me Guides</a></h2><blockquote>I&rsquo;m going to create a simple program that will delete personal information like deleteme. It&rsquo;ll be open-source and able to run whenever you please. I&rsquo;ll use the guides from deleteme to help identify services and their links.
I have each link listed below, but you can run the code below to download every document.

I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d lose his head… again. To further Herennius&rsquo; delight, Cicero didn&rsquo;t even write those lines! To do justice to his legacy, I present Cicerkov: The Cicero Markov Chain.
To follow along, download his work here. There is an interactive demo in JavaScript below, though, but it uses a prerun model of window size two.

This conveniently followed the release of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a low-power SoC. I purchased this board since I doubt my website will warrant anything stronger than a Raspberry Pi and it enables solar-power with its small energy footprint.
There is a thorough article comparing servers&rsquo; abilities handling different types of data; however, I opted to use Go&rsquo;s built-in web server.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/googleinterview/>Short and Sweet Google Interview Process</a></h2><blockquote>I&rsquo;ll use this post as a progress report of the Google Internship application process. The only unique thing I did in regards with the initial application was specifying my interest in the ChromeOS team. In addition, I submitted a bug report to the ChromeOS team and mentioned my application. I don&rsquo;t know if this helped move me forward, but it was something different I did compared to previous applications.
