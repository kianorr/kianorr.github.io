<mark>13 minutes</mark></small><p>I&rsquo;ve been using the Raspberry Pi Foundation&rsquo;s products for almost a decade now, but they only recently released their first microcontroller. Their custom RP2040 has an ARM Cortex-M0+ chip that, obviously, uses ARM assembly. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn assembly and this is definitely a great opportunity to do so.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/runcode.html>Searching for Interactive Code</a></h2><small><i>September 3, 2021</i>

Recently, I added code that scrapes DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s !bangs; however, the reader would need to run the code on their own machine. It&rsquo;d be helpful if they could have executable code embedded in the post.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/privacytools.html>Exploring Privacy Tools</a></h2><small><i>September 2, 2021</i>
