This will be an ongoing post about interesting things I learn, as a way to share a computer scientist&rsquo;s perspective on quantum physics as well as to hold myself accountable in finishing the course.
The miracle is not that electrons behave oddly. The miracle is that when you take $10^{26}$ electrons, they behave like cheese! üßÄ
The first lecture taught me something fundamental about the term superposition.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/grokkinggo/>Grokking Go</a></h2><blockquote>Despite an earlier post being so optimistic about the IPFS, I decided to self-host this site. I&rsquo;m only leaving IPFS because this site will never be popular enough to be on any node besides my own. In this way, I was already hosting from the start. It all began as a fun endeavor to apply Go, but has since led to a certificate and obsessive refinement of the server.
Most recently, I have added the ability to edit and create posts from within this site!</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/quantumsummer/>Summer of Quantum</a></h2><blockquote>This summer will be affectionately known as the Quantum Summer.
Because of a scheduling mishap, I found myself teaching three quantum courses at once:
Brookhaven National Laboratory Qiskit Global Summer School QuBes Camp This situation pushed me to balance responsibilities and make tons of quantum resources. As a result, I became inspired to buy www.quantumforay.com; a fun play on quantum fourier.
Now, equipped with the QF website, I am inspired to make an amazing quantum curriculum from determining what worked best at the three quantum schools.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/nnfs/>Neural Networks From Scratch</a></h2><blockquote>The best way to learn how something works is to build it from scratch. Unsurprisingly, the Neural Networks from Scratch book does exactly that.
I had the privilege to edit it alongside Harrison and Daniel, and wanted to write about my experiences editing a technical book.
On January 10th, 2020, Harrison, or sentdex, released a YouTube video announcing a Kickstarter campaign for funding Neural Networks From Scratch. On January 10th, I backed the Kickstarter üòÇ This was the first time I would formally edit something, as well try my hand at understanding the inner workings of neural networks.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/quantumtales/>Quantum Tales</a></h2><blockquote>Shortly after becoming an IBM Qiskit Advocate, I was introduced to the Unitary Fund. After writing a story where the reader uses Shor&rsquo;s algorithm to decrypt a stock listing, I wanted to create more stories teaching quantum algorithms.
With the help of the Unitary Fund, I was able to realize this dream. I created a series of stories that teach various quantum algorithms. The stories are all rooted in classic fairy tales from around the world, except the protagonist now employees their quantum prowess to succeed.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/writingtools/>Tools For Writing</a></h2><blockquote>Half a year ago, I began the process of writing my first book. This book is special to me because it attempts to teach middle schoolers and those without experience, quantum. By using fairy tales everyone is familiar with, it is easier to teach new topics. I found that younger audiences were able to learn new material better when that knowledge was introduced in the context of popular stories. In this way, I will use stories from around the world to help teach many people the basics of quantum and inspire them to learn more.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/blockchain/>Future of Blockchain Domains</a></h2><blockquote>I bought this domain (splch.zil) today! I have a .dev/net domain, but I don&rsquo;t like the idea of renting a space. When I discovered blockchain domain names and IPFS hosting, I knew it suited me.
It all depends on security and privacy Now, I don&rsquo;t know what the future holds for blockchain and IPFS internet, but I think that the importance of publicly served domains will increase by considering present privacy trends.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/flag2emoji/>Converting Country Codes to Flag Emojis</a></h2><blockquote>In a Flutter app I started ‚Äî and eventually stopped ‚Äî working on, I was converting country codes to their corresponding flag emojis in Dart. This was a fun problem to solve and it&rsquo;s actually my highest rated solution on StackOverflow, so I wanted to save it here!
String countryCode = 'us'; String flag = countryCode.toUpperCase().replaceAllMapped(RegExp(r'[A-Z]'), (match) => String.fromCharCode(match.group(0).codeUnitAt(0) + 127397)); print(flag); .toUpperCase() Make all characters uppercase</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/poems/>Poems</a></h2><blockquote>Alexandre Alexandre, my trembling wings.
Your dead are in the fields.
Our fight was stretched on the forest.
A wealth of shadow lies beneath the woodland hills.
An earth that is not mine.
Skies A sky became a wave,
and suddenly the breeze -
azure floating on the hills.
Our music was not of a god or spirit, not of that colour of the sea.
falafel My falafel from the seas and palm-trees.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/ee/>IB CS Extended Essay</a></h2><blockquote>&ldquo;How feasible are deep neural networks in generating thematically diverse video game music?&rdquo;
Introduction Research The purpose of this paper is to test the ability of deep neural networks (DNNs), using long short-term memory architecture to model video game (VG) music and evaluate its aptitude in expressing thematically diverse emotion. In other words, how feasible are deep neural networks in generating thematic video game music? My goal is to test whether a DNN can compose engaging music capable of accentuating themes presented in video games.</blockquote></section></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
