# BrickPi3 Worm Brain # Written by Spencer Churchill 2016, in Python 2.7 # The BrickPi3 Worm Brain uses a Postsynaptic dictionary based on the C Elegans Connectome Model # This application can be ran on the Raspberry Pi BrickPi robot with an ultrasonic sensor that represents Nose Touch when activated from BrickPi import * import time BrickPiSetup() # setup the serial port for communication BrickPi.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/m-protect/>M-Protect</a></h2><blockquote>M-Protect, the virus protector that promised everything and fulfilled nothing, was an overnight sensation.
