The catch was that the encoded QR code would match the encoded string of the QR code. When you scan the QR code, it would return itself.
Sadly, this is most likely impossible, though I might still try to create a search function for it. Instead, I optimized Alok&rsquo;s approach a bit with Javascript&rsquo;s arrow syntax.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/lastis/>The Last Single-Letter Domain</a></h2><blockquote>√Ω.is is now taken. This morning, I began rummaging through the NCIS&rsquo; Domain Rules and found a list of all allowed single characters.

Their custom RP2040 has an ARM Cortex-M0+ chip that, obviously, uses ARM assembly. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn assembly and this is definitely a great opportunity to do so.
The goal is to code a very basic neural network in assembly.
I want to make a simple neural network, and luckily the Pico has a multiplication instruction (unlike the 6502 processor).</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/runcode/>Searching for Interactive Code</a></h2><blockquote>I want readers to execute code I use anywhere in my blog. Recently, I added code that scrapes DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s !bangs; however, the reader would need to run the code on their own machine. It&rsquo;d be helpful if they could have executable code embedded in the post.
I searched the internet for popular online IDEs and found those listed below. I wanted to compare features and languages to determine which I should use in my blog (if any).</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/privacytools/>Exploring Privacy Tools</a></h2><blockquote>The brain has been hacked and its security patches come slowly. In order to avoid targeted ads and refining my digital consciousness, I&rsquo;m making steady progress toward respectful technology.
After learning more about AI, I began to understand the importance of privacy. Everyone has their own reasons for protecting their data, and mine is to reduce the ability of models to fit me. This ties into preventing ad recommendations and other popular motivations broadly, but I doubt we understand the implications of modelling human behavior.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/pentestddg/>Testing DuckDuckGo's Email</a></h2><blockquote>DuckDuckGo began releasing @duck.com emails. These emails are currently in beta and only act as an email-forwarding account. The purpose of this post is to stess-test the service and see where it earns the beta tag.
Duck.com vs. Duck.co Both duck.com and duck.co forward to duckduckgo.com, so I wondered if a duck.com and duck.co email forward emails identically as well. When I tried emailing spence@duck.co, however, I received the following 550 error:</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/ddgbangs/>Every Bang in DuckDuckGo</a></h2><blockquote>In response to a question about a list of all DuckDuckGo !bangs, I wrote this script:
from requests import get from json import loads def get_bangs(): r = get('https://duckduckgo.com/bang.v260.js') r = loads(r.text) return r def create_dict(bangs): d = {'Misc': set()} for i in bangs: el = (i['s'].strip(), i['t'].strip()) try: if i['c'] in d: d[i['c']].add(el) else: d[i['c']] = set(el) except: d['Misc'].</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/tlds/>The Best TLD is Not .com</a></h2><blockquote>The TLD is controlled by its parent company or country. When choosing a TLD, consider the site to be strictly under the laws of the country that ultimate controls it. For example, if you use a .ae domain, with a single query from the monarchy, your site could be completely removed. On the otherhand, if you use a domain from‚Ä¶ well let&rsquo;s get into it üòâ
The EFF outlined a comparison of TLDs.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../../../posts/creatingmysite/>Creating My Site</a></h2><blockquote>I bought my first domain through Google Domains and actually hosted my site through Google&rsquo;s website builder. It really is a great free builder with solid SEO, but I&rsquo;m a programmer, so I wanted to program.
Distributed networks are an amazing technology, and I was drawn to IPFS hosting. I used Pinata to pin my new site, but when I tried using an HTTP request for a different page, it failed.</blockquote></section></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
