|</small><p>Despite an earlier post being so optimistic about the IPFS, I decided to self-host this site. I&rsquo;m only leaving IPFS because this site will never be popular enough to be on any node besides my own. In this way, I was already hosting from the start.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/quantumsummer.html>Summer of Quantum</a></h2><small><i>July 15, 2021</i>
|</small><p>This summer will be affectionately known as the Quantum Summer.
Because of a scheduling mishap, I found myself teaching three quantum courses at once:
Brookhaven National Laboratory Qiskit Global Summer School QuBes Camp This situation pushed me to balance responsibilities and make tons of quantum resources.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/nnfs.html>Neural Networks From Scratch</a></h2><small><i>May 18, 2021</i>

<mark>2 minutes</mark></small><p>The best way to learn how something works is to build it from scratch. Unsurprisingly, the Neural Networks from Scratch book does exactly that.
I had the privilege to edit it alongside Harrison and Daniel, and wanted to write about my experiences editing a technical book.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/quantumtales.html>Quantum Tales</a></h2><small><i>May 18, 2021</i>
|</small><p>Shortly after becoming an IBM Qiskit Advocate, I was introduced to the Unitary Fund. After writing a story where the reader uses Shor&rsquo;s algorithm to decrypt a stock listing, I wanted to create more stories teaching quantum algorithms.
With the help of the Unitary Fund, I was able to realize this dream.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/writingtools.html>Tools For Writing</a></h2><small><i>May 15, 2021</i>

<mark>2 minutes</mark></small><p>Half a year ago, I began the process of writing my first book. This book is special to me because it attempts to teach middle schoolers and those without experience, quantum. By using fairy tales everyone is familiar with, it is easier to teach new topics.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/blockchain.html>Future of Blockchain Domains</a></h2><small><i>May 14, 2021</i>
|</small><p>I bought this domain (splch.zil) today! I have a .dev/net domain, but I don&rsquo;t like the idea of renting a space. When I discovered blockchain domain names and IPFS hosting, I knew it suited me.
It all depends on security and privacy Now, I don&rsquo;t know what the future holds for blockchain and IPFS internet, but I think that the importance of publicly served domains will increase by considering present privacy trends.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../../posts/flag2emoji.html>Converting Country Codes to Flag Emojis</a></h2><small><i>September 18, 2020</i>

Your dead are in the fields.
Our fight was stretched on the forest.
A wealth of shadow lies beneath the woodland hills.
An earth that is not mine.
