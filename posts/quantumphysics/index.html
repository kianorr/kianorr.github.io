This will be an ongoing post about interesting things I learn, as a way to share a computer scientist&rsquo;s perspective on quantum physics as well as to hold myself accountable in finishing the course.</p><blockquote><p>The miracle is not that electrons behave oddly. The miracle is that when you take $10^{26}$ electrons, they behave like cheese! üßÄ</p></blockquote><p>The first lecture taught me something fundamental about the term <em>superposition</em>. As I used quantum computers, I thought about the <abbr title="Quantum Binary Digit">qubit</abbr>s as being both 0 and 1 while in superposition; however, this is <strong>false</strong>. The qubit is in no meaningful state: not 0, not 1, not both, and not neither.</p><p>In the second lecture, this idea of superposition is again reiterated by the famous double-slit experiment, where an electron neither passes through the top nor bottom slits, neither both nor no slits. Contuining to experimentally demonstrate quantum properties, Professor Adams then proved <a href=https://https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem>Bell&rsquo;s Inequality</a> very simply as $P(a \cup \overline{b}) + P(b \cup \overline{c}) \geq P(a \cup \overline{c})$. Perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, electrons&rsquo; angular momenta in the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> axes, which are either up or down, do not abide by Bell&rsquo;s Inequality. However, this <strong>is</strong> very surprising, because simple logic and integers must be flawed at a fundamental sense to not accurately describe quantum properties.</p><p><img src=../../images/ocw2.webp alt=OCW></p><p>I&rsquo;m tempted to take a <a href=https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-yeeqmse01-quantum-mechanics-scientists-and-engineers>course</a> now, because doing problem sets for a course designed to be taken in-person is tedious.
