<mark>2 minutes</mark></small><p>Using the keyboard delay and blog authorship datasets, we can derive a keyboard that is optimized for the shortest delays between the most common key presses. For example, if x to q has the shortest delay of 33ms, but t to h is the most frequently occurring key presses, then we can replace x with t and q with h.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/chinese/>Chinese Word List</a></h2><small><i>April 6, 2022</i>

<mark>87 minutes</mark></small><p>I used the SUBTLEX-CH frequency list to list the top 100 Chinese words per part of speech. There are 2,683 words on this page. From rough estimates, this should cover 78% of spoken Mandarin. The lists are sorted first by</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/meancolor/>The Meanest Color</a></h2><small><i>March 24, 2022</i>

<mark>2 minutes</mark></small><p>Have you ever wanted to know what the most mean color is? Red might come to mind — a fiery and belligerent color. But I&rsquo;ll do one better! I&rsquo;ll give you the color vector that&rsquo;s closest to every other color vector.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/pgp/>Generating a PGP Key</a></h2><small><i>March 23, 2022</i>

<mark>6 minutes</mark></small><p>This is an extreme guide to generating a PGP key. A simple tutorial will suffice; however, this will help generate the most secure key possible.
Quantum Background The NIST compared the security of RSA and ECC keys and concluded that, with sufficient lengths in key complexity, either standard will suffice.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/averagergb/>RGB for Average Contrast</a></h2><small><i>March 17, 2022</i>

<mark>2 minutes</mark></small><p>I&rsquo;m working on an interpreted assembly-like language called Bee Assembly, and the editor&rsquo;s background will change from a light or dark color depending on the user&rsquo;s preference. It uses Simple.css to style the page, so I wanted to avoid adding additional CSS rules.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/randomness/>Degrees of Randomness and the Law of Large Numbers</a></h2><small><i>February 4, 2022</i>

<mark>6 minutes</mark></small><p>In a previous post comparing quantum and avalanche diode methods of true random number generation, an interesting pattern emerged. The quantum random numbers would pass more STS tests than avalanche diode random numbers. Seemingly, the quantum RNG converges to a mean before the diode RNG.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/cleaninggbc/>Deep Cleaning a Game Boy Color</a></h2><small><i>January 23, 2022</i>

<mark>2 minutes</mark></small><p>I&rsquo;ve been using my old Game Boy Color a lot more now that I&rsquo;m programming a GB game, so I wanted to clean up the handheld! This tutorial is the culmination of a few YouTube videos from The Retro Future and Odd Tinkering.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/listsofgames/>Comprehensive Lists of the Best Retro Nintendo Games</a></h2><small><i>January 21, 2022</i>

|
<mark>6 minutes</mark></small><p>This post will derive an optimal Wordle-specific guessing strategy. The approach taken will be reducing the set of possible words a maximum amount for each guess; however, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to keep reducing the set of words until the final guess, so we&rsquo;re reintroduced to our old friend, the explore-exploit tradeoff.</p></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/piratesfolly/>Pirate's Folly</a></h2><small><i>January 11, 2022</i>

<mark>3 minutes</mark></small><p>The Raspberry Pi Pico inspired the release of the Picosystem. I love working with limited hardware as a challenge to improve my programming. I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of 6502 assembly for the NES but recently enjoyed the new RP2040. The Picosystem uses the RP2040 to run games, so I just had to try it out!</p></section><nav><a href=../posts/page/2/>→</a></nav></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
