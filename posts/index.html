For example, if x to q has the shortest delay of 33ms, but t to h is the most frequently occurring key presses, then we can replace x with t and q with h. This approach maps keys with regard to finger agility. The proposed algorithm greedily replaces the keys with the shortest delay with the most frequently used keys, so it won&rsquo;t be an optimal solution.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/chinese/>Chinese Word List</a></h2><blockquote>I used the SUBTLEX-CH frequency list to list the top 100 Chinese words per part of speech.
There are 2,683 words on this page. From rough estimates, this should cover 78% of spoken Mandarin. The lists are sorted first by total counts of each part of speech, then by the word itself. For example, verbs are the most common words in Mandarin, and the most common verb is &ldquo;是&rdquo;. So, the list begins with Verbs and its first entry is &ldquo;是&rdquo;.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/place/>r/place</a></h2><blockquote>On 28 March 2022, a reboot of Place was announced. It began on 1 April 2022, and lasted for four days, including two expansions across the experiment. As of Sunday night, 3 April, nearly 72 million tiles were placed by over 6 million users, at a pace of more than 2.5 million tiles placed per hour; it was a sixfold increase in the number of users on Reddit between the two experiments, including a 4.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/meancolor/>The Meanest Color</a></h2><blockquote>Have you ever wanted to know what the most mean color is? Red might come to mind — a fiery and belligerent color. But I&rsquo;ll do one better! I&rsquo;ll give you the color vector that&rsquo;s closest to every other color vector.
Here, the most average and mean color can be determined with word2vec and vector averaging.
Process Load the word2vec model Load the list of colors Sum the vectors of each color together Divide by the number of colors Find the color vector with the largest cosine similarity to that vector Python pip install gensim import numpy import gensim.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/pgp/>Generating a PGP Key</a></h2><blockquote>This is an extreme guide to generating a PGP key. A simple tutorial will suffice; however, this will help generate the most secure key possible.
Quantum Background The NIST compared the security of RSA and ECC keys and concluded that, with sufficient lengths in key complexity, either standard will suffice.
Shor&rsquo;s algorithm factors coprime numbers, thus is able to recreate the private key to any RSA-generated public key. This NIST paper, however, asserts that Grover&rsquo;s algorithm can be used to recreate the private key to any ECC-generated public key.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/averagergb/>RGB for Average Contrast</a></h2><blockquote>I&rsquo;m working on an interpreted assembly-like language called Bee Assembly, and the editor&rsquo;s background will change from a light or dark color depending on the user&rsquo;s preference. It uses Simple.css to style the page, so I wanted to avoid adding additional CSS rules. Instead, I opted to find the best red, green, and blue values to maximize the contrast between the white and black backgrounds, and the text. I also found the average gray value.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/randomness/>Degrees of Randomness and the Law of Large Numbers</a></h2><blockquote>In a previous post comparing quantum and avalanche diode methods of true random number generation, an interesting pattern emerged. The quantum random numbers would pass more STS tests than avalanche diode random numbers. Seemingly, the quantum RNG converges to a mean before the diode RNG.
This should not be the case since both methods produce true random numbers, so this post will be exploring if this is actually occurring and why.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/cleaninggbc/>Deep Cleaning a Game Boy Color</a></h2><blockquote>I&rsquo;ve been using my old Game Boy Color a lot more now that I&rsquo;m programming a GB game, so I wanted to clean up the handheld! This tutorial is the culmination of a few YouTube videos from The Retro Future and Odd Tinkering. I liked a lot of their tips, so I decided to add them and my own to this post.
Tools: Tri-Point Y1 Screwdriver Phillips Head Screwdriver Cotton Swab Tooth Brush 99% Isopropyl Alcohol The higher percentage, the faster the evaporation Vinegar Disassembly Unscrew the 4 Tri-Wing screws on the back of the GBC 1.</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/listsofgames/>Comprehensive Lists of the Best Retro Nintendo Games</a></h2><blockquote>I combed the web for Top 100 lists for the *NES and GB* and combined them to record the most beloved 975 games. This master table is helpful when making ROM libraries or finding something tried, true, and new to play.
Here is the unfiltered data on Google Sheets. The raw tab has most lists in order, but some lists went from 100-91, 90-81, …, 10-1, so it&rsquo;s either in order or very out of order!</blockquote></section><section><h2><a href=../posts/bestwordlestrategy/>Best Wordle Strategy — Explore or Exploit</a></h2><blockquote>This post will derive an optimal Wordle-specific guessing strategy. The approach taken will be reducing the set of possible words a maximum amount for each guess; however, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to keep reducing the set of words until the final guess, so we&rsquo;re reintroduced to our old friend, the explore-exploit tradeoff.
The first question we need to answer is, given six guesses, how many should be exploring which consonants and vowels are and aren&rsquo;t present, and how many should exploit that knowledge to guess the word?</blockquote></section></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
