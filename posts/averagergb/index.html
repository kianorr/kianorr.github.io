It uses <a href=https://simplecss.org/>Simple.css</a> to style the page, so I wanted to avoid adding additional CSS rules. Instead, I opted to find the best red, green, and blue values to maximize the contrast between the white and black backgrounds, and the text. I also found the average gray value. If others want to compute more colors, I&rsquo;ll add them to the list below.</p><p>In the browser&rsquo;s developer tools, you can hover over elements with the selector and see the contrast rating under Accessability. I simply adjusted the color values to minimize the difference between contrasts over white and black backgrounds.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Color</th><th>Value</th><th>Contrast</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Red (Communist)</td><td>#ec0000</td><td>4.575</td></tr><tr><td>Green (Almost Not Green Anymore)</td><td>#008900</td><td>4.575</td></tr><tr><td>Blue (Historical Baby Powder)</td><td>#5f5fff</td><td>4.575</td></tr><tr><td>Gray (Sonic Silver)</td><td>#757575</td><td>4.575</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Interestingly, the average contrast of gray isn&rsquo;t the average of #000000 and #ffffff. I was expecting <code>rgb(255 / 2, 255 / 2, 255 / 2)</code>, so <code>#7f7f7f</code> or <code>#808080</code>, but it&rsquo;s <code>rgb(117, 117, 117)</code>. Also, blue required adding red and green to reduce the contrast difference since it&rsquo;s practically unreadable without. Red and green could carry their own without mixing. I&rsquo;m curious why these things occur and how they&rsquo;re related.</p><p>I also found a fun site called <a href=https://colornames.org/>COLORNAMES</a> that aims to name every hex color. I used it to find the top names for these colors. As of writing this post, 2,896,184 colors have been named, so only $256^3-2,896,184=13,881,032$ are left to go! I took this opportunity to add another color to the list ðŸ˜‰. Should be finished by 2043, so act quick!</p><p>Back on topic, I figured these colors might be useful for some people who just want a single coloring scheme for their website regardless of background colors. Obviously, if the site isn&rsquo;t using a light or dark background, it won&rsquo;t be a good idea to use this, though.</p></main><footer></footer></body></html>
