It began on 1 April 2022, and lasted for four days, including two expansions across the experiment. As of Sunday night, 3 April, nearly 72 million tiles were placed by over 6 million users, at a pace of more than 2.5 million tiles placed per hour; it was a sixfold increase in the number of users on Reddit between the two experiments, including a 4.5-fold increase in tiles being placed. Unlike in 2017, individual subreddits immediately began to coordinate pixel art, and large communities were formed on Discord and Twitch in attempts to create, defend, and destroy territory. Different communities collaborated and formed alliances through Discord as well as subreddits. Large streamers on Twitch also participated by instructing thousands (in some cases hundreds of thousands) of their viewers to mark their logos and symbols. On both the second and third days, Reddit doubled the canvas size and expanded the color palette. On the final day, before the 2022 Place reboot ended, users were suddenly restricted to placing white pixels; therefore, the entire canvas was gradually filled with a white void, returning it to its original blank state.</p><p>There were many griefs and reprisals from various factions, with Twitch streamer xQcOW (a.k.a. Félix Lengyel) being particularly impactful (at one point peaking with more than 233,000 live concurrent viewers, a personal record). He received death threats for griefing, saying that he had received more death threats in a single hour than he had received in six years of streaming.</p><p>Place was immediately used to express support for Ukraine in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was depicted with sunglasses, and it was suspected that Russian bots were used in a vain attempt to deface Zelenskyy&rsquo;s visage, although this attack was thwarted.</p><p>References to popular culture and Internet memes were commonly visible. Similar to 2017, much of the artwork was nationalistic. These often combined flags with their country&rsquo;s landmarks, celebrities, technology, or popular exports. This was particularly evident in the case of France, the United States, and Germany, while Dutch and Turkish Redditors collaborated to make real life paintings and a mural of Barış Manço. A flag of Canada was the subject of humor with regards to the difficulties of the design of the maple leaf.</p><p>2022 also saw the return of the Blue Corner, the void, the rainbow road, LGBT flags, and the green lattice (although all in diminished capacity). There was another prominent promotion for the 2007 video game osu!.</p><p>The experiment was praised for creating a sense of collectivism at a time when the Internet was to a great extent fractured and polarized. However, censorship and admin abuse were noted, with one piece of art depicting a scantily clad woman, encouraged by Twitch streamer xQc, being censored. Bot usage was also again criticized. The Washington Post compared Place to The Million Dollar Homepage, a one-million-pixel website where each pixel was sold for a dollar in 2005.</p><ul><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_(Reddit)>Wikipedia</a></li></ul></main><footer><small>Thanks to <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> for building and <a href=https://simplecss.org/>SimpleCSS</a>
