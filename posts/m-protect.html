After amassing a cult following of thirteen-year-olds and becoming the sponsor of the school&rsquo;s crossfire tournament, this antivirus program was seemingly on the up and up. However, its ambition would become its downfall.</p><blockquote><p>Getting things done â€” that&rsquo;s the M-Protect way</p></blockquote><p>This all started when I learned that I could very easily make <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>s with Visual Basic. I&rsquo;m not sure why I settled on making a fake antivirus, but it might&rsquo;ve been because I liked Avast and its <a href=https://blog.avast.com/2012/11/16/what-is-the-avast-autosandbox-and-how-does-it-work>sandbox feature</a> a lot. Despite the reason, I knew having buttons and progress bars was enough to look legitimate, so I set out with Microsoft Paint and Visual Studio to make my first program.</p><p>The first version was very simple: no popup windows, only some interactive elements, and no ghastly red and blue color scheme. This needed to change. It&rsquo;s clear that version 2 was more advanced, but that wasn&rsquo;t good enough for me. I wanted something intelligent, beautiful, and enough to catch the eyes of my peers. For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnhljtJE99k">version 3</a>, I wanted something <em>bold</em>, so I promised a redesign and a heuristic scanner. The only problem was I didn&rsquo;t know how to code. To continue development, I downloaded a fancy looking program&rsquo;s source code, but none of its libraries ðŸ˜‚ The end of M-Protect had come when I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-S6dUIqQ28">dependency Hell</a>.</p><p><img src=../images/mprotect2.webp alt="M-Protect v2"></p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t seriously start learning to code for another three years, but this experience definitely influenced my curiosity for computer science. In addition to the programming experience, I gained a surprising amount of advertising experience too.</p><ul><li><a href=https://spencerchurchill.wixsite.com/m-protect>Wix</a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Uo7AEBp-BAZPBcoiHA_kw>YouTube</a></li></ul><p>Part of me wants to hide M-Protect away forever but another part admires getting an entire class excited about a piece of software, let alone one that didn&rsquo;t work. Actually I take that back&mldr; I think the second version scanned for the <a href=https://wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)>string</a> &ldquo;virus&rdquo; in files, but either way, it was very suspect ðŸ˜‚</p><p>Check out <a href=https://archive.org/details/m-protect>the <abbr title=Executables>exes</abbr></a> if you&rsquo;d like, but they&rsquo;re mostly here for preservation.</p><aside><hr><details open><summary>Related Content</summary><ul><li><a href=../posts/minecraftseeds.html>Minecraft Seeds</a></li><li><a href=../posts/googleinterview.html>Short and Sweet Google Interview Process</a></li><li><a href=../posts/qrquine.html>QR Quine</a></li><li><a href=../posts/runcode.html>Searching for Interactive Code</a></li><li><a href=../posts/quantumsummer.html>Summer of Quantum</a></li></ul></details></aside></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
