After writing a <a href=https://link.medium.com/y1zFy6ThYhb>story</a> where the reader uses Shor&rsquo;s algorithm to decrypt a stock listing, I wanted to create more stories teaching quantum algorithms.</p><p>With the help of the <a href=https://unitary.fund>Unitary Fund</a>, I was able to realize this dream. I created a series of stories that teach various quantum algorithms. The stories are all rooted in classic fairy tales from around the world, except the protagonist now employees their quantum prowess to succeed.</p><p>This project is ongoing and will hopefully cover a wide range of algorithms and tales alike. The <a href=https://quantumtales.org>QuantumTales</a> site will have the most up-to-date information as well as previews. The <a href=https://github.com/splch/quantum-tales/>GitHub repository</a> is the second place to look for code and additional information.</p></main><footer></footer></body></html>
