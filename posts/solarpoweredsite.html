This conveniently followed the release of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 <abbr title=Wireless>W</abbr>, a <a href=https://hackaday.com/2021/11/01/the-pi-zero-2-w-is-the-most-efficient-pi/>low-power</a> <abbr title="System on a Chip">SoC</abbr>. I purchased this board since I doubt my website will warrant anything stronger than a Raspberry Pi and it enables solar-power with its small energy footprint.</p><p>There is a <a href=https://www.jeremymorgan.com/tutorials/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-web-server-comparison/>thorough article</a> comparing servers&rsquo; abilities handling different types of data; however, I opted to use Go&rsquo;s built-in web server. My primary reason is the ease of adding new features with Go is too much to trade for C&rsquo;s minor improvements.</p><p>The way my site works is it populates the initial HTML with markdown files. Instead of reloading an entire page, files are dynamically requested. Markdown rendering occurs on the client-side, reducing server usage past what an established framework currently offers (to my knowledge). If you&rsquo;d like to check out how my site works, visit the <a href=https://github.com/splch/slc.is>GitHub repo</a>.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t too big of a deal, though, because the Pi uses barely any energy. In fact, an average load only draws around 200 mA.</p><details><summary>Solar Calculations</summary><p>My house gets around 1,918 hours of <a href=https://sunroof.withgoogle.com/>sunlight</a>, so that&rsquo;s a ratio of $\frac{1918 ; hours}{365.25 ; days \times 24 ; hours} \approx 0.22$ usable hours of sunlight.</p><p>This means at a potential draw of 200 mA, the server would consume $200 ; mA \times 24 ; hours = 4800 ; mAh$ a day. In addition, with 22% or $24 ; hours \times 0.22 \approx 5 ; hours$ of usable daylight, the solar panels must capture $\frac{4800 ; mAh}{5 ; hours} \approx 1000 ; \frac{mA}{hour}$. This assumes 100% conversion rates. Good panels convert around 20% of the sunlight. This effectively means I need $\frac{1 ; A}{0.2}=5 ; \frac{Amps}{hour}$ from the panel.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation recommends a <a href=https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-zero-2-w>5 Volt</a> <abbr title="Power Supply Unit">PSU</abbr>, so, the watt hours is $5 ; A \times 5 ; V = 25 ; W$. With this requirement, the <a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EXWCPLC/>BigBlue</a> panel seems like a good choice. It includes a USB port, so I won&rsquo;t need a separate regulator.</p><p>For the battery, I should get one that can handle the other 78% of unusable hours of light. This means more than $200 ; mA \times 24 ; hours \times 0.78 = 3750 ; mAh$ would suffice for a single day. Adding some wiggle room, I think <a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FDXDB3W/>10,000 mAh</a> will be fine for a couple days of bad weather. I&rsquo;ll update this page later with uptime statistics, but entering winter makes for a rough time! ðŸ˜…</p><blockquote><p>There were some great sales which is why I chose those two items specifically; and the whole setup only cost around $100 (not including internet fees).</p></blockquote></details><p>The math above is a little disorganized since I used this write-up to figure it out; however, the calculator below will quickly determine your own solar needs from either your latitude or hours of the day, and voltage and current or wattage.</p><iframe frameborder=0 src=https://solarbattery.splch.repl.co></iframe><p>I definitely recommend giving the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W a look. It&rsquo;s extremely energy-friendly and packs quite a punch. The power per watt is nothing to laugh at â€” with the new unified memory design, there&rsquo;s definitely an air of M1 about. Of course, at 512 Mb of <abbr title="Random-Access Memory">RAM</abbr> this won&rsquo;t be viable for some people, but it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction. If you&rsquo;re thinking about some hobby projects, keep sustainable tech in mind.</p><p>Hopefully this helps someone get the gear they need to host their solar sites! If you&rsquo;re able to read this article, then the <abbr title="Solar Server Pi">S.S. Pi</abbr> ðŸ¥§ is chuggin&rsquo; along.</p><aside><hr><details open><summary>Related Content</summary><ul><li><a href=../posts/wormpi.html>Raspberry Pi and Caenorhabditis Elegans</a></li><li><a href=../posts/manjarochromebook.html>Installing Manjaro Linux on Chromebook</a></li><li><a href=../posts/creatingmysite.html>Creating My Site</a></li><li><a href=../posts/randomness.html>Degrees of Randomness and the Law of Large Numbers</a></li><li><a href=../posts/assemblypico.html>Assembly Neural Network on Pico</a></li></ul></details></aside></main><footer><small>Thanks to a <a href=https://gohugo.io/>gopher</a> for building and the <a href=https://ipfs.io/>galaxy</a>
