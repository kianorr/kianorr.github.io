If you&amp;rsquo;d like to view the entire list, download the JSON file. Its structure is:

Red might come to mind — a fiery and belligerent color. But I&amp;rsquo;ll do one better! I&amp;rsquo;ll give you the color vector that&amp;rsquo;s closest to every other color vector.
Here, the most average and mean color can be determined with word2vec and vector averaging.

A simple tutorial will suffice; however, this will help generate the most secure key possible.
Quantum Background The NIST compared the security of RSA and ECC keys and concluded that, with sufficient lengths in key complexity, either standard will suffice.
Shor&amp;rsquo;s algorithm factors coprime numbers, thus is able to recreate the private key to any RSA-generated public key. This NIST paper, however, asserts that Grover&amp;rsquo;s algorithm can be used to recreate the private key to any ECC-generated public key.</description></item><item><title>RGB for Average Contrast</title><link>/posts/averagergb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/averagergb/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on an interpreted assembly-like language called Bee Assembly, and the editor&amp;rsquo;s background will change from a light or dark color depending on the user&amp;rsquo;s preference. It uses Simple.css to style the page, so I wanted to avoid adding additional CSS rules. Instead, I opted to find the best red, green, and blue values to maximize the contrast between the white and black backgrounds, and the text.

The quantum random numbers would pass more STS tests than avalanche diode random numbers. Seemingly, the quantum RNG converges to a mean before the diode RNG.
This should not be the case since both methods produce true random numbers, so this post will be exploring if this is actually occurring and why.</description></item><item><title>Deep Cleaning a Game Boy Color</title><link>/posts/cleaninggbc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cleaninggbc/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my old Game Boy Color a lot more now that I&amp;rsquo;m programming a GB game, so I wanted to clean up the handheld!

The approach taken will be reducing the set of possible words a maximum amount for each guess; however, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to keep reducing the set of words until the final guess, so we&amp;rsquo;re reintroduced to our old friend, the explore-exploit tradeoff.

The Picosystem uses the RP2040 to run games, so I just had to try it out!

Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll compare them for feasibility and quality. The feasibility of a TRNG is how many bits per second it can produce while remaining random. And that leads us into quality which will be determined according to the NIST&amp;rsquo;s STS. We&amp;rsquo;ll also compare these methods against the computer&amp;rsquo;s default RNG as a baseline.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the Arcetri Team&amp;rsquo;s implementation of the STS.</description></item><item><title>Custom Gates in Qiskit with Pulse</title><link>/posts/customqiskitgates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/customqiskitgates/</guid><description>Quantum research often requires applying operations in novel ways; however, it&amp;rsquo;s occasionally necessary to create gates to reduce circuit length. If too many operations are applied to a qubit, the quantum state is lost and no valuable insight can be gained. The quantum compiler can optimize these steps, but having the ability to create custom microwave pulses to apply to qubits is valuable.
In this quick tutorial, we will compose a Hadamard pulse and apply it to a qubit through a circuit using Qiskit.</description></item><item><title>Installing Manjaro Linux on Chromebook</title><link>/posts/manjarochromebook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/manjarochromebook/</guid><description>1.

Introduction Research The purpose of this paper is to test the ability of deep neural networks (DNNs), using long short-term memory architecture to model video game (VG) music and evaluate its aptitude in expressing thematically diverse emotion. In other words, how feasible are deep neural networks in generating thematic video game music? My goal is to test whether a DNN can compose engaging music capable of accentuating themes presented in video games.</description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi and Caenorhabditis Elegans</title><link>/posts/wormpi/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/wormpi/</guid><description>One of my first projects was AI projects was taking the OpenWorm C. Elegans brain map and connecting it to a Raspberry Pi. The Pi was integrated with Lego Mindstorms, so the Lego motors would move in the direction the worm wanted to go.
