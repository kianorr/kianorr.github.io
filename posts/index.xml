for 3 of them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I really enjoyed making these because I was able to play around with some different art styles also while contributing to something that I care about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>first attempt at astrophotography</title><link>https://kianorr.com/posts/astro/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2023 15:17:05 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/posts/astro/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this month, I camped in Anza Borrego for a night with my friend Matt to try out some astrophotography. The camping itself went alright &amp;ndash; it was cold, which I expected, but I did not think about how cold the ground was going to be when trying to sleep (didn&amp;rsquo;t bring a mat like a smart person).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took about 700 pictures, each with a 5 second exposure, of the orion nebula with a camera that Matt let me borrow. I used Siril for post-processing, where I essentially followed &lt;a href="https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/742945-how-good-is-siril/">this guide&lt;/a>. I had trouble with the photometric color calibration step (kept on getting an error about plate solving) so I did the manual color calibration instead. This is the result:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RK4 speeds in python, julia, and c++</title><link>https://kianorr.com/posts/rkspeeds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 15:17:05 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/posts/rkspeeds/</guid><description>I wanted look more into Julia because it sounded like python but faster and better. So, I compared Julia to Python, and also threw C++ in there (do I regret that? Maybe)</description></item><item><title>code and graphic design</title><link>https://kianorr.com/posts/code-graphics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 15:17:05 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/posts/code-graphics/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wanted to look into the intersection between graphic design and code.
I found a program called Processing, where you can code in Java, C++ or Python.
After trying a few simple things, this animation seemed to be pretty cool:&lt;/p>

There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem
to support it.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>The code for it is below. There are two functions that automatically run,
&lt;code>setup()&lt;/code> (runs once like &lt;code>__init__&lt;/code>) and &lt;code>draw()&lt;/code> (continuously runs). So I just
continuously increased the radius at which that ellipse is at, as well as it&amp;rsquo;s angle with
a couple sines and cosines to make it dynamic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my experience at APS DPP 2022</title><link>https://kianorr.com/posts/aps-experience/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kianorr.com/posts/aps-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p>This event took place between Oct 16th and Oct 21st in Washington and
was the first APS conference I have attended. I ended up really liking the
location. Spokane is a medium sized city, but had the energy of a small town,
which I enjoyed quite a bit. They even had a good book shop :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was an amazing experience because it basically took every single subfield
of plasma and formed it into a convention of great people displaying their
work.
It exposed me to a lot of new topics like dusty plasmas or runaway electrons,
as well as deepened my interest for other areas like computational plasma.
But I think I could work on talking and introducing myself to people at posters.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
